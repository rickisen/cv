            </div>
            <p>
              Since 2016/2017 I've worked both as a contractor and consultant
              on various web projects and react-native app projects. Before
              this I studied at MI, and before that I worked as a contractor in
              film post-production.

                <h4>Qasa (App / Web)<span class="no-mobile secondary">react-native / react / expo</span></h4>
                <p>
                  Qasa is a company/website that helps people sublet and
                  rent homes. Not dissimilar to Airbnb but with a focus on
                  long term living.</br>
                  At Qasa I worked on their future version of their website and a
                  react-native project. And I gained a lot of insights in how
                  to do shared code between react-native and regular web react.

                <h4>Mitt Fortum (App)<span class="no-mobile secondary">react-native / TypeScript</span></h4>
                <p>
                  Fortum is a huge Swedish energy company that offers a
                  website and app used to manage people's energy usage and
                  subscription.</br>
                  On this project I worked exclusively as a
                  react-native dev as a part of the App team.
                  At Fortum I gained experience in working in large companies, and with
                  the extensive security and testing that entails.

                <h4>Maîtres (Web)<span class="no-mobile secondary">golang / react / back-end / stripe</span></h4>
                <p>
                  Maîtres is a restaurant App primarily focused on VIP
                  customers. It facilitates contact between a restaurant's
                  head waiter and VIP customer. Allowing for a smooth and human
                  feeling booking experience. It features automatic payment (just get
                  up and walk away, no need to wait for the bill). It also
                  features a rating system. Quite similar to Uber. </br>
                At this project i worked as a back-end programmer using golang,
                and I also worked on a react based waiter panel.  I got lots of
                experience with the payment provider "stripe", websockets and
                POS systems (trivec).

                <p>
                  Tui is a big charter company in northern Europe. A big part
                  of their marketing is the usage of a beloved cartoon
                  character "Bamse". And as part of this they decided to make
                  a children's game that kids could play on the aircraft on the
                  way to their holiday destination. </br>
                I worked on this project together with 4 devs and I primarily
                worked on the mini-games "Build a Sandcastle" and "Feed Bamse".

                <p>
                  A restaurant website for a (at the time) new restaurant in
                  Gothenburg. I wrote a wordpress theme, and some custom
                  plugins for this site and it featured some cool scroll based
                  effects.
                  After they opened and launched the restaurant they switched to another website solution. <br/>
                  So this link is no longer the site i coded:

                <p>
                  Zag is a design company based in London. They are a part of
                  BBH which gave me this contract.  I built this site using
                  react for the front-end and the back-end was node based using
                  the keystone-js framework (a headless CMS). </br> The site
                  was designed and coded to be a cool blog/portfolio. But
                  they've since changed approach and use another less bloggy
                  solution. </br>
                  So this link is no longer the site i coded:

                  Just a small site I designed and coded in wordpress for a

                  It's nothing impressive, but it's the only thing on here I designed all on my own (except this CV site itself).</p>

                  I've also worked on other projects I can't really describe
                  here because of NDA. But they entail react-native and IoT
                  (internet of things) stuff.

              At the end of my FED studies at MI, I did a 4 month long
              internship at BBH-Stockholm. During this period I got to work on
              some projects I later did consultant/contractor work on.  They
              offered me full time employment, But I felt like continuing my
              Freelance business.

              used QT and C++ to make these.

              During the last half of 2015 to april 2017 I studied at a
              webdev and design school called MI (the Media Institute) in
              Stockholm. The course had just changed name to FED (Front End
              Developer) when I started. It used to be called "Web developer", so
              it still entailed a lot of back-end and SQL stuff. It was about
              60% front-end, the rest back-end or various development stuff
              like agile development and scrum techniques etc.

              Feels a bit silly putting this here, as everybody self educate
              to some point. But I actually turned down work and traveled to
              another country just to focus 100% on learning myself c/c++.
              Amongst other things I read  the books "Accelerated C++" and "C++ Primer 5th edition".
              And I did a lot of educational websites and projects during this period that lasted ~6 months.
              But I've always been a computer nerd, and I can't even remember the first time I coded.

              I have used Linux as my primary OS since I was 20 years
              old. I love the whole FOSS community and I can be pretty
              passionate about it. But I'm also a practical guy and I don't let
              it get in the way of solving problems, especially not in a
              professional setting. But you'll probably notice a tux sticker on
              all my things.

              I often spend my free time doing small techy hobby projects,

              remote controlled car with a web cam, or simply tinkering with my
              custom built router to do various useful things.
